    **Create Image** context menu

1. In the **Create Image** dialog box, type a unique name and description, and then choose **Create Image**\. By default, Amazon EC2 shuts down the instance, takes snapshots of any attached volumes, creates and registers the AMI, and then reboots the instance\. Choose **No reboot** if you don't want your instance to be shut down\.
**Warning**  
If you choose **No reboot**, we can't guarantee the file system integrity of the created image\.

It may take a few minutes for the AMI to be created\. After it is created, it will appear in the **AMIs** view in AWS Explorer\. To display this view, double\-click the **Amazon EC2 \| AMIs** node in AWS Explorer\. To see your AMIs, from the **Viewing** drop\-down list, choose **Owned By Me**\.
